##  Defining the Known Parameters
```{r}
p_ever_smoked <- 0.25  # proportion ever smoked cigarettes
p_ever_marijuana <- 0.15  # proportion ever smoked marijuana
age_first_mean <- 12  # mean age first approached
age_first_sd <- 1  # SD of age first approached
cv_target <- 0.05  # desired coefficient of variation
```

## Calculating the element variances
```{r}
# Calculating Variance for binary proportions = p(1-p)
var_ever_smoked <- p_ever_smoked * (1 - p_ever_smoked)
var_ever_marijuana <- p_ever_marijuana * (1 - p_ever_marijuana)

# Variance is SD squared
var_age_first <- age_first_sd^2

cat("Variance for ever smoked:", round(var_ever_smoked, 3), "\n")
cat("Variance for ever marijuana:", round(var_ever_marijuana, 3), "\n")
cat("Variance for age first approached:", round(var_age_first, 3), "\n")
```
