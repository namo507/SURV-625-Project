Inferences:

Right! So the analysis reveals striking differences in required sample sizes across variables, driven by their inherent variability and prevalence. 

We see that Ever Used Marijuana stands out, demanding the largest sample (2,267) to achieve a 5% coefficient of variation. This reflects its lower prevalence (15%) and higher relative variability, which amplifies uncertainty and necessitates more observations for precise estimation.

Ever Smoked, with a higher prevalence (25%), requires fewer samples (1,200). The broader base of individuals whoâ€™ve smoked reduces variability, making it easier to estimate reliably.

Most notably, Age First Approached defies expectations that only 3 samples are needed. This suggests remarkably low variability in the population (variance = 1.0), with most individuals reporting their first exposure around age 12. Interestingly, the tightly clustered data means even a tiny sample accurately captures the mean, highlighting a well-defined behavioral pattern.
