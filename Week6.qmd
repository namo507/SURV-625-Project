## Initial Parameters
```{r}
# Design effects from previous study
deff_smoked <- 2.5    # design effect for ever smoked cigarette
deff_marijuana <- 2.0 # design effect for ever smoked marijuana
deff_age <- 1.7      # design effect for age when first asked

# Previous study parameters
n_students <- 7500    # total sample size
n_clusters <- 150     # number of clusters (schools)

# Average cluster size
b_bar <- n_students / n_clusters
cat("Average cluster size (b-bar):", b_bar, "\n")

# Cost parameters
total_budget <- 500000  # total budget
cost_per_cluster <- 3000 # cost per school
cost_per_student <- 50   # cost per completed questionnaire
```

## Calculate Synthetic roh Values

Using the formula: roh = (deff - 1)/(b_bar - 1)

```{r}
# Function to calculate roh
calculate_roh <- function(deff, b_bar) {
  roh <- (deff - 1)/(b_bar - 1)
  return(roh)
}

# Calculate roh for each variable
roh_smoked <- calculate_roh(deff_smoked, b_bar)
roh_marijuana <- calculate_roh(deff_marijuana, b_bar)
roh_age <- calculate_roh(deff_age, b_bar)

# Create results table
roh_results <- data.frame(
  Variable = c("Ever Smoked", "Ever Marijuana", "Age First Asked"),
  Design_Effect = c(deff_smoked, deff_marijuana, deff_age),
  Roh = c(roh_smoked, roh_marijuana, roh_age)
)

knitr::kable(roh_results, 
             digits = 4,
             caption = "Synthetic roh Values by Variable")
```

## Optimal Design Calculations
We'll use the calculated roh values to determine the optimal cluster size and number of clusters given our budget constraints.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

# We'll use the largest roh (Ever Smoked) to be conservative
roh_max <- max(roh_smoked, roh_marijuana, roh_age)

# Function to calculate optimal cluster size given roh and cost parameters
# Formula: n_opt = sqrt((cost_per_cluster)/(cost_per_student * roh))
calculate_optimal_cluster_size <- function(cost_cluster, cost_student, roh) {
  n_opt <- sqrt(cost_cluster / (cost_student * roh))
  return(n_opt)
}

# Calculate optimal cluster size
n_opt <- calculate_optimal_cluster_size(cost_per_cluster, cost_per_student, roh_max)
n_opt_rounded <- round(n_opt)

# Calculate how many clusters we can afford
# total_budget = (cost_per_cluster + cost_per_student * n_opt) * m_opt
# Solve for m_opt
m_opt <- total_budget / (cost_per_cluster + cost_per_student * n_opt_rounded)
m_opt_rounded <- floor(m_opt) # We round down to stay within budget

# Calculate total sample size
total_sample <- n_opt_rounded * m_opt_rounded

optimal_design <- data.frame(
  Parameter = c("Optimal Cluster Size (n_opt)", 
                "Rounded Cluster Size",
                "Optimal Number of Clusters (m_opt)",
                "Rounded Number of Clusters",
                "Total Sample Size",
                "Total Cost",
                "Average roh",
                "Expected Design Effect"),
  Value = c(n_opt,
            n_opt_rounded,
            m_opt,
            m_opt_rounded,
            total_sample,
            (cost_per_cluster + cost_per_student * n_opt_rounded) * m_opt_rounded,
            mean(c(roh_smoked, roh_marijuana, roh_age)),
            1 + (n_opt_rounded - 1) * roh_max)
)

knitr::kable(optimal_design, 
             col.names = c("Parameter", "Value"),
             digits = c(0, 2),
             caption = "Optimal Design Parameters")
```

## Cost Analysis

Calculating maximum possible number of clusters and students given budget constraints:

```{r}
# Function to calculate total cost
calculate_total_cost <- function(n_clusters, students_per_cluster) {
  cluster_costs <- n_clusters * cost_per_cluster
  student_costs <- n_clusters * students_per_cluster * cost_per_student
  total_cost <- cluster_costs + student_costs
  return(total_cost)
}

# Function to calculate maximum clusters and students
calculate_max_samples <- function(budget, cost_cluster, cost_student) {
  # Maximum possible clusters if all budget spent on clusters
  max_clusters <- floor(budget/cost_cluster)
  
  # Maximum possible students if all budget spent on students
  max_students <- floor(budget/cost_student)
  
  return(list(max_clusters = max_clusters, 
              max_students = max_students))
}

max_samples <- calculate_max_samples(total_budget, cost_per_cluster, cost_per_student)

cat("Maximum possible clusters (if only clusters):", max_samples$max_clusters, "\n")
cat("Maximum possible students (if only students):", max_samples$max_students, "\n")
```

## Summary Table

```{r}
summary_df <- data.frame(
  Parameter = c("Average Cluster Size (b-bar)", 
                "Total Budget",
                "Cost per Cluster",
                "Cost per Student",
                "Maximum Possible Clusters",
                "Maximum Possible Students",
                "Optimal Cluster Size",
                "Optimal Number of Clusters",
                "Total Sample Size"),
  Value = c(b_bar,
            total_budget,
            cost_per_cluster,
            cost_per_student,
            max_samples$max_clusters,
            max_samples$max_students,
            n_opt_rounded,
            m_opt_rounded,
            total_sample)
)

knitr::kable(summary_df, 
             col.names = c("Parameter", "Value"),
             digits = 0,
             caption = "Summary of Key Parameters")
```


Inferences:

The results highlight how intra-cluster correlation (ICC) directly shapes sampling efficiency. With ICC values ranging from 0.014 (Age First Asked) to 0.031 (Ever Smoked), schools exhibit moderate homogeneity in student behaviorsâ€”particularly for smoking. 

This clustering effect amplifies the required sample size, as seen in the design effect of 2.32, meaning nearly twice as many students are needed compared to a simple random sample.

Balancing cost and precision, the optimal design selects 96 schools with 44 students each (totaling 4,224 students). This strikes a middle ground between two extremes i.e. surveying 166 schools (maximizing geographic spread but undersampling students) or 10,000 students (ignoring school-level costs entirely). Not only that but the choice reflects real-world constraints like school recruitment expenses ($2,500 per school) and per-student data collection costs ($100), while prioritizing statistical power.

Now the reason this works is:

* Higher ICCs (e.g., smoking behavior) demand more clusters to capture between-school variability.
* The 44-student cluster size minimizes variance inflation from within-school similarities.
* Budget allocation mirrors practices in education research, where fixed cluster costs often dominate.

Practical considerations:
* Non-response adjustments helps in building a 10-15% buffer to ensure final samples meet power requirements.
* Parameter justification shows that benchmarking against prior studies (e.g., similar school-based smoking surveys) strengthens methodological credibility.
* Cost transparency helps in explicitly separating cluster/student costs helps stakeholders understand tradeoffs.
